How to communicate with service
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You must write json data into `/run/mpm` fifo file. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import json
    data = {}
    data["pid"] = str(os.getpid())
    data["new-mode"] = "performance"
    with open("/run/mpm","w") as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(data))

**Note:** pid value required.

If you send a data to service, service will automatically update client status.
